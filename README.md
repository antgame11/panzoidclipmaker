# Clip Maker 2 & 3

## Why?
I wanted the reliability of having a desktop app when using Panzoid's Clip Maker tools. Unfortunately, they're browser based and they put a subscription on their website which makes me wonder if they'd further progress the subscription and make it paid for everyone (eventually.) My solution was backing it up and fixing a few bugs (and adding a few improvements.)
